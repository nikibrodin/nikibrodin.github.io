# What do you think of static site generators?  
I think that it is a powerful and easy tool once you get the hang of it. It is very easy to get started, the threshold is lower, but to really understand everything and feel competent using it you have to give it some time, in my opinion. They are fast, easy to update, the content is verison controlled, and it is relatively secure. 

# What type of projects are they suitable for?  
They are suitable for blogs, projects and other smaller more descriptive sites.
