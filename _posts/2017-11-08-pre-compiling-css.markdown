# What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?  
I think that it is easier to read once you understand it, there is less code compared to regular CSS and less repetition.  
This is achieved by creating variables that can be inherited, by nesting selectors so that it is easier to read, and by using mixins. 


# Which techniques did you use?  
I copied the minima.scss file and made some changes to it, but in so doing I got to use nesting and variables. I think that they were very useful, and it was not to hard to understand how it all worked.
